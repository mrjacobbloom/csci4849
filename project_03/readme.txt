PROJECT 3: ScantTastic Toe
Jacob Bloom

This is ScanTastic Toe, the single-switch, scanning-tastic version of Tic Tac
Toe. Use the space bar to choose a space. Every time you choose a space it gets
faster, and when you try to choose an unavailable space it gets EVEN FASTERER!!
The user can customize the scanning speed and the AI intelligence (how many
steps ahead it can predict).

Open index.html to play!

The AI is borrowed from Ali Alaa's Tic Tac Toe project on Github:

			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<h3>Instructions</h3>
			<p>
				This is a one-button scanning interface like we saw in class. Use any
				key to choose a row, then to choose a column or cancel and go back to
				row selection.
			</p>

			<h3>Test Results</h3>
			<p>
				I decided to test whether the length of the time interval has any real
				effect of error rate and input speed. I timed myself entering 3
				equations into the calculator with interval times 250ms and 500ms. Here
				are my results:
			</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Interval (ms)</th>
						<th>Equation</th>
						<th>Errors</th>
						<th>Completion time (secs)</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>250</td>
						<td>76+81=</td>
						<td>5</td>
						<td>57.95</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>250</td>
						<td>34+6=</td>
						<td>3</td>
						<td>35.42</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>250</td>
						<td>12/6+9=</td>
						<td>3</td>
						<td>34.29</td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td>500</td>
						<td>76+81=</td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>17.49</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>500</td>
						<td>34+6=</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>17.50</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>500</td>
						<td>12/6+9=</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>21.12</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>
				I was able to achieve far more accurate results in less total time with
				the longer interval length; however, I seemed to get more comfortable
				with the high-speed scanning as I went, so a power-user might be able to
				achieve fairly high accuracy at this kind of speed with a little
				practice.
			</p>
			<p>
				One thing that struck me was that it was much harder to choose
				the first and last items in a given row than ones in the middle at the
				higher speed because the jump to the beginning of the row is
				disorienting. One direction for further experimentation would be
				something that alleviates this. For example, a change in the scanning
				speed as you near the edges, or a scanner that bounces back and forth
				instead of wrapping around could both help with this.

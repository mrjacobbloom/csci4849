      <h2>Experiment Summary</h2>
      <img class="float-right" src="./settings.png" width="300" alt="GoFitts configuration"/>
      <p>
        Our team sought to explore the link between throughput and the act of
        either ascending or descending a staircase. We organized a test of
        throughput via the Fitts' Law experiment application
        <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/mack/FittsLawSoftware/doc/index.html?GoFitts.html">GoFitts</a>
        with 4 test subjects (the authors).
      </p>
      <p>
        For each direction, subjects completed a pointing test that consisted of
        12 "blocks" of 5 trials each. It was administered on a laptop, which was
        held in the subject's non-dominant hand while they completed the
        pointing tasks with their dominant hand. First, the subject would
        complete the tests while ascending the stairs. Then, they would complete
        the tests again while descending the stairs. We asked subjects to start
        each trial when they reached the second step of the staircase, and to
        try to complete each trial before they reached the landing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The settings we used for the GoFitts trial are shown to the right.
      </p>
      <h2>Data & Analysis</h2>
      <div id="columnchart_material" class="border"></div>
      <p>
        Our tests did not show evidence of a significant difference in
        throughput between when a test subject is ascending or descending a
        staircase.
      </p>
      <h2>Further Experimentation</h2>
      <p>
        This experiment really begs more questions than it does provide
        answers. For example, does the size or length of the staircase have a
        meaningful effect on throughput? We had subjects try to complete each
        trial before they reached the landing, which likely affected their pace.
        A longer staircase (or better yet, a stair-stepper machine) might yield
        interestingly divergent results.
      </p>
      <p>
        One variable that may have tainted our data is exhaustion. It's possible
        that, without allowing for cool-down time between the ascending and
        descending conditions, subjects were more winded during the descending
        part of the experiment.

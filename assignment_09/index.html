      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        This is an experiment in Augmentatitive and Alternative Communication
        (AAC). It simulates eye tracking via cursor position and uses dwell to
        determine clicks. The idea is to type a message to be spoken later.
        Then, while it's being spoken, use a slider in real time to adjust the
        tone of the following word. The hope is that this finer-grained control
        over prosody will make it possible to express a more diverse range of
        emotion via an AAC system.

        The keyboard is based off of the one we saw demo'd in class and in
        <i>Gleason</i>. This is not a fully-working prototype. It works well
        enough with the mouse to get the point across but it hasn't been tested
        with actual eye-tracking software and I made some design decisions that
        are not necessarily well-suited to eye-tracking. Here are a few
        forseeable issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It's not particularly full-featured. It's missing punctuation, which
          is itself one of the most important prosodic markers in written
          speech and is necessary for writing contractions in a way the TTS
          engine will understand. Oh well.
        </li>
        <li>
          A dwell is canceled as soon as the mouse leaves the button, which
          wouldn't actually work for eye-tracking because of saccades as
          we've discussed in class.
        </li>
        <li>
          The slider is undoubtedly horribly unergonomic for eye-tracking. The
          reason it doesn't use dwell like the keyboard is because JavaScript's
          speech APIs don't tell me how long an "utterance" will take, so
          there's no way to predict how long one might have the opportunity to
          dwell before the next word begins.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Something else that might be worth exploring is real-time tone
        modification mid-word. This isn't possible with JavaScript's speech API
        but it might be possible with proprietary AAC software.
      </p>

        <strong>NOTE:</strong> Due to browser policies, audio may not play until you've
        clicked somehere on the page. If you hit "speak" and nothing happens,
        click anywhere and try again.
